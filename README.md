# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on data from a kickstarter in order to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to breakdown Louise's kickstarter data in order to gain deeper insight into the campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and goals the Kickstarter had. 


## Analysis and Challenges

The most challenging part of the assignment was ensuring that the code had been written correctly and that the numbers on the Launch Date and Goals sheets were accurately representing what I had intended to showcase. In order to overcome this challenge I just had to consistently look over my formulas and try to find any mistakes in syntax that could have lead to a misrepresentation of the true results. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two conclusions that can be made about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that over 60% of the theatre shows were successful. Another conclusion that can be made is that the summer months were far more successful in comparison to the winter months. There is a significant difference in the number of successful shows in May, June and July than compared to other months. 	

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The conclusion that can be made based on the outcomes based on goals sheet is that there were far more projects conducted with goals ranging in the 1000 to 4999 range than any other. The 1000 to 4999 range group had 1225 total projects while all the other ranges combined totalled 1242 projects. Given that the success percentage in this range is significantly high in comparison to most the other goal ranges, it is clear that this goal range is the most effective for Louise. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations of these data sets are that they are specific to certain Subcategories of the entire Kickstarter data. Therefore they cannot be represented for the whole Kickstarter campaign but rather very specific parts of it. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Including a table of all parent categories and comparing them to each other would be a way to gain a better general overview of the entire dataset.
